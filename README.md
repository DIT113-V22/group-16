## What are we going to make?
We are going to do an Android software that allows an end user to control a smart car remotely. This app will allow users to control and watch a live stream of the car by the camera. Besides, the smart car can detect obstacles around it and avoid it using embedded sensors for it to travel freely. The smart car also have the featurs such as emergency breaking system.Also the smart car have the Cruise function.



## Why we want make it? 
We want make an app that let users can controled the car easly and safely when the car is not so far with the user.
    Scenario:
    In winter, it may take a while for the user to come out of the room to the parking space. If he uses a mobile phone to remotely control his car to the door, it will avoid the cold caused by just leaving the room.

 ## How are we going to make it?
During the making of the car mostly arduino and the SMCE-gd will be used.Because we are making an Android app so we will use the Android studio.For programming language, Java and C/C++ will be used to developed software for the project.
The team will work with agile development methods.

## Features of the App

1. [Manual Control](https://github.com/DIT113-V22/group-16/wiki/Milestone-2#milestone-2-manual-control)
2. [Cruise Control](https://github.com/DIT113-V22/group-16/wiki/Milestone-2#milestone-2-cruise-control)
3. [Obstacle Avoidance](https://github.com/DIT113-V22/group-16/wiki/Milestone-1#milestone-1-obstacle-avoidance)
4. Obstacle Warning
5. [Video Streaming](https://github.com/DIT113-V22/group-16/wiki/Milestone-3#milestone-3-video-streaming)

## Techologies
SMCE-gd
MQTT
Arduino
Android Studio
C/C++
Java
Github
Gradle
## Function and technology correspondence
1. Use UI of Android studio to let the App have the UI can control the car.
2. Use the MQTT broker connect the Android app and SMCE-gd.
3. Use Utlrasonic sensor to detect obstacle to achieve the Obstacle Avoidance.
4. Use the Infrared sensor to achieve the Obstacal Warning.
