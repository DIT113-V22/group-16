## What?
  A software that allows an end user to control a smart car remotely. This app will allow users to control and watch a live stream. Besides, the smart car can detect obstacles around it and avoid it using embedded sensors for it to travel freely. The smart car also have the featurs such as emergency breaking system, automatic pathing and parking. (Depends on the time and resourses, the scope will change).

## Why?
Modern car market is focused on: 
automatic cruise control, system that warns you of obstacles and rear camera to aid with parking
Market also is shows signs of shifting to:
self driving cars
cars that can park themselves
cars that can avoid obstacles themselves

## How?
During the making of the car mostly arduino and the SMCE will be used. Android Studio and C/C++ will be used to developed software for the project.
The team will work with agile development methods
