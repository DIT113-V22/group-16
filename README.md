  <h2> What? </h2>
  <p>  For this project, we plan to create a desktop software that allows the end user to control a smart car remotely. This app will allow users to control and watch a live stream. Besides, the smart car can detect obstacles around it and avoid it by the emergency breaking system which using embedded sensors for it to travel freely. Along with manually maneuvering the car, the car would also can drive at a constant speed, no user action is required as long as no obstacles are encountered.

  <h2> Why? </h2>
  <p>
Modern car market is focused on:  
cars that can avoid obstacles themselves
  </p>
  <h2> How?</h2>
  <p>During the making of the car mostly arduino and the SMCE will be used. Java and C/C++ will be used to developed software for the project.
  
The team will work with agile development methods.
We will use agile working methods to complete the tasks of each sprint. We will have regular group meetings to discuss and decide what we will do before our next meeting. In addition, we will have Q&A sessions with teaching assistants or teachers throughout our project to make adjustments to our products
